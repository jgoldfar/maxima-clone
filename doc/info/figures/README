INTRODUCTION
------------

The figures in this directory will be used in the Maxima manual.
Each figure should be in two versions, PDF and PNG. The PDF version
will be used in the PDF version of the manual, and the PNG version
will be used in the HTML version.

CREATING FIGURES FOR THE MAXIMA MANUAL
--------------------------------------

If the figures are the result of a plot2d or plot3d command, the two
versions needed can be created adding the options pdf_file and
png_file to the plotting command. For example, the two commands needed
to produce the figure "plotting6", shown in the file plotting6.mac,
are the following:

plot2d(sin(x), [x, -%pi, %pi], [pdf_file, "./plotting6.pdf"]);
plot2d(sin(x), [x, -%pi, %pi], [png_file, "./plotting6.png"]);

The two files "plotting6.pdf" and "plotting6.png" can then be
created by runnig Maxima in batch mode:

maxima -b plotting6.mac

ADDING FIGURES TO THE MANUAL
----------------------------

Once the files "plotting6.pdf" and "plotting6.png" have been created
in the doc/info/figures directory, they should be added in a section
of the manual using the following syntax:

@altfigure{plotting6,Descriptive text}

Notice that no file-name extension or directory should be given. That
way, "plotting6.png" will included in the HTML version of the manual
and "plotting6.pdf" will be inserted with a width of 10 cm into the PDF
version of the manual. In the info version of the manual the following
will appear:
  (Figure plotting6: Descriptive text)

The "Descriptive text" is important to describe the figure for someone who
is not looking at it. For instance, when a user is reading a manual section
using "describe" in the Maxima console, or a blind user hearing to a screen
reader describe what's in an HTML page of the manual.

There is an older macro, @figure, which takes only one argument, the name of
the file, and will use that name also as descriptive text.

MACROS THAT HELP CREATING FIGURE FILES IN THE NEEDED FORMATS
------------------------------------------------------------

../docdraw.mac contains macros that create a figure in both formats
needed for building the documentation:

docdraw("test",gr2d(explicit(sin(x),x,1,10)));
docdraw2d("test",explicit(sin(x),x,1,10));
docdraw3d("test",explicit(sin(x)*cos(y),x,1,10,y,1,10));


In order to ease the use of the figures found in the manual as a testbench
for the plotting functions all new plot commands should be added to
the .wxm files in the "tests" directory of the maxima source tree.
