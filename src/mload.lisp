  When searching for a file whose name doesn't contain wildcards, but the
  directory does contain wildcards, e.g. '/home/username/.maxima/**/package.mac',
  then a list of all directories, their modification timestamps and a hash
  table of previous searches inside these directories are cached.
  When querying the cache, the current modification timestamps are compared to
  the cached ones. Only if they match, the cache can be used.
  If any directory was modified within the last *DIRECTORY-CACHE-MDELTA*
  seconds, then the cache is not used (see documentation for
  *DIRECTORY-CACHE-MDELTA*).
  The actual file search is implemented by iterating over the list of
  directories and testing whether a file with the given name exists there.
  MTIME-CACHE must be a hash table. It will be used to cache modification
  timestamps of directories. NEW-FILE-SEARCH can call DIRECTORY-CACHED multiple
